This project is a fork of https://github.com/libretro/Lakka-LibreELEC that adds support for the RetroDeluxe handheld game console.
The support consists in:
- A custom splash logo
- A modified device tree adapted to the hardware
- A simple daemon written in C that reads the volume up/down buttons and adjust the sound volume consequently
- The automatic configuration of the Teensy-based controller
